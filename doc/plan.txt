- get a remaining class
	- prefer classes that are involved in large restrictions first
- attempt to book multiple sections with the same professor
	- find a list of professors with the applicable department
	- prefer a professor with multiple sections still open
	- when preference is tied, pick a random one
- rooms are more scarce of a resource, so find available rooms for that department and that professor
	- prefer continuity in time, so room use is as efficient as possible
	- when multiple are available and continuity is the same:
		- use as much of a room as possible, try to keep some unused
		- otherwise, pick a random one
	- if none are available, try a different professor
	- otherwise, pick a preferred schedule
		- applicable day combinations are MWF, TR, MW, and MF
		- attempt for continuous blocking
			- find a class with a large enough chunk of time after it to fit another class
